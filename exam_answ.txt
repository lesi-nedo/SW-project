Q8.
  1. would be:
    :renManuscript2 :hasAuthor :author3 .
    
    or in protege:
    add to renManuscript1 Object property assertions, "hasAuthor author3"
    
    It violates the constraint that a manuscript should have exactly one writer, i.e., a functional object axiom. 
    
  2. would be:
     :book4 :hasPrice "34"^^xsd:string .
     
     or in protege:
     create a Data property assertion, "hasPrice 34 of type string"
     
     It violates the data type axioms, which state that the 'hasPrice' data property should be a positive integer.
     
Q9.
  SubObjectPropertyOf(ObjectPropertyChain (isPublishing hasManuscript workBelongsTo) hasPublicationAgreement)
  
Q10.
  It needs to satisfy:
    1. owl:topDataProperty
     It does satisfy cause all datatypes of my ontology are sub-property of topDataProperty.
      
    2. Datatypes
     My ontology is satisfying because I've used only data types included in the datatype map of OWL.
     
    3. Simple Roles
      My ontology is satisfying as it avoids using forbidden composite object properties in axioms.
      
    4. Property Hierarchy
       SubObjectPropertyOf(ObjectPropertyChain (isPublishing hasManuscript workBelongsTo) hasPublicationAgreement) does not inroduce cycles, so it does.
       
    5. Anonymous Individuals
      My ontology doesn't include anonymous individuals, so it is considered satisfied.
